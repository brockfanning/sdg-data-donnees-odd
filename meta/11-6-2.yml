SDG_GOAL: '<p>Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient
  and sustainable</p>'
SDG_TARGET: '<p>Target 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental
  impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal
  and other waste management</p>'
SDG_INDICATOR: '<p>Indicator 11.6.2: Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter
  (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted)</p>'
STAT_CONC_DEF: <p>The mean annual concentration of fine suspended particles of less
  than 2.5 microns in diameters (PM2.5) is a common measure of air pollution. The
  mean is a population-weighted average for urban population in a country, and is
  expressed in micrograms per cubic meter [&#xF06D;g/m<sup>3</sup>].</p>
