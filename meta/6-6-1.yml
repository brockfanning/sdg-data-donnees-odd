STAT_CONC_DEF: |
  Indicator 6.6.1 tracks the extent to which different types of water-related
  ecosystems are changing in extent over time. The indicator is multifaceted capturing
  data on different types of freshwater ecosystems and to measure extent change the
  indicator considers spatial area changes, water quality and water quantity changes.
  The indicator uses satellite based Earth observations to globally monitor different
  freshwater ecosystems types Earth observation data series on surface area are available
  on permanent water, seasonal water, reservoirs, wetlands, mangroves; as well as
  generating data on water quality the using trophic state and turbidity of water
  bodies. Satellite images can be represented as numerical data, which in turn are
  aggregated into meaningful statistics of ecosystem change attributed to administrative
  areas such as national, sub-national (e.g. regions and provinces) and river basin
  boundaries. Global data products for river flows and groundwater level have not
  yet been produced at useful spatial and temporal resolutions to be incorporated
  into this SDG 6.6.1 methodology. Currently, these data should continue to be provided
  from modelling or from ground-based measurements and required from the countries.
  <br>
  <br>Extent - As used in the title of this indicator, 'extent' is expanded beyond spatial extent
  to capture additional basic parameters needed for the protection and restoration of water-related
  ecosystems. Extent includes three components - the spatial extent or surface area, the quality, 
  and the quantity of water-related ecosystems.
  <br>
  <brSurface Water refers to any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. This includes the 
  following 3 water-related ecosystem categories: rivers and estuaries, lakes, and artificial waterbodies.
  <br>
  <br>Reservoirs are artificial (or human-made) bodies of freshwater, as opposed to lakes which are naturally 
  occurring. The reservoirs dataset represents surface area data on artificial water bodies including reservoirs 
  formed by dams, flooded areas such as opencast mines and quarries, flood irrigation areas, and water 
  bodies created by hydro-engineering projects such as waterway and harbour construction.
  <br>
  <br>Turbidity is an indicator of water clarity, quantifying the haziness of the water and acting as an indicator of 
  underwater light availability.
  <br>
  <br>Trophic State refers to the degree at which organic matter accumulates in the water body and is most 
  commonly used in relation to monitoring eutrophication.
  <br>
  <br>Change means a shift from one condition of extent to another over time within a water-related ecosystem, 
  measured against a point of reference. Surface-water extent changes are compared against a 20-year reference 
  period (baseline)
DATA_COMP: |
  Combined surface-water changes = permanent + seasonal + reservoir changes. Changes
  in surface-water area are observed in 2015 and 2020, which are compared against a 20-year
  reference period.
